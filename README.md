Part of Assignment 2 in the CS4131 Module at NUS High School.

An app for post‐vaccine’s safe management measures, similar to the ["Green Pass" implemented in Israel](https://www.dw.com/en/israel-reopens-economy-after-covid-vaccine-success/a-56642980).

Here are some features we have implemented:

## Account System

You can create a profile with your NRIC, Full Name, Email, Password and Date Of Vaccination.

## An Actualized Pass

The pass is a simplified `CardView`. It contains your Name and Date of Vaccine.

### Shake

You can actually shake the device to open the pass.

## Settings

- Dark Mode
- Shake to open pass
